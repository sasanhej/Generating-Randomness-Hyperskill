<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In the final stage, we will gather all the components to construct a game where you will try to beat the system. Initially, the player has a virtual balance of $1000. Every time the computer guesses a symbol correctly, the player loses one dollar. Every time the system is wrong, the player gets one dollar.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this final stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print two new lines at the start:
	<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Please provide AI some data to learn...
The current data length is 0, 100 symbols left</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Get and preprocess user input just like in stage 1;</li>
<li>Learn the user patterns by collecting triad statistics like in stage 2;</li>
<li>Prompt the user to play a game or type <code class="java">enough</code> to exit the game. Use the following phrases:
	<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">You have $1000. Every time the system successfully predicts your next press, you lose $1.
Otherwise, you earn $1. Print "enough" to leave the game. Let's go!</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Ask the user to enter random strings. Each random string must be preprocessed to have only <code class="java">0</code> and <code class="java">1</code> symbols. After preprocessing the string length must be 4, at minimum. If this is not the case — ask to enter a whole new string again. Use this text: <code class="java">Print a random string containing 0 or 1:</code>;<br/>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Now we are playing a game. And you need to ask to enter a random string, not a test string as before. Please pay attention to this.</div></li>
<li>Launch the prediction algorithm and calculate the number of correctly guessed symbols, like in stage 3. After each iteration, you should calculate the remaining balance and show it with the message <code class="java">Your balance is now $X</code>, where <code class="java">X</code> is the player's virtual balance. For example, if the program guessed 4 out of 7, then the balance will decrease by 1 (lost: 4, won: 3); it will be $999;</li>
<li>It would be great if you keep updating the system by allowing it to learn from new data as well. However, this update should happen only when the prediction and the verification stages are done — be honest with the user;</li>
<li>Finish the game with the words <code class="java">Game over!</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Before implementing the solution, examine the example carefully. The output of your program should provide instructions and feedback in the same format.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Please provide AI some data to learn...

You have $1000. Every time the system successfully predicts your next press, you lose $1.
Otherwise, you earn $1. Print "enough" to leave the game. Let's go!

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:
