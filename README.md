# Generating-Randomness-Hyperskill
This is "Generating Randomness" project form Hyperskill.<br>
In addition to raising the metaphysical question of free will, this project will introduce the basics of Python data types and probability theory, including randomness. Get a grasp of the necessary math concepts, learn about geometrical probability, and see how simple statistics can predict a particular outcome. From a programmer's perspective, sharpen your skills with list comprehensions, strings, and dictionaries.<br>
Everyone knows that people are bad at generating random things. In this project, we will check this assumption using a small self-written program that will predict "random" user actions. We'll see if you can beat it!<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
